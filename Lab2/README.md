# Lab 2: Azure DevOps - Pipelines for a Linux Web App (Express/NodeJS)

## Web app urls

- Production/Released Web App: https://sd-release-web-application.azurewebsites.net/
- Development Web App: https://sd-web-application.azurewebsites.net/
- Screenshots of the project: ./Lab2/Screenshots

## Goals and processes

This project's goal has been to exercise and get familiar with building a **_Release-Pipeline_** in **_Azure_**.

Thus...

1.  Very simple _Linux_ web app has been setup in _NodeJS_ with _Express_
2.  Sample test case (with _Jest_) created in the web app folder

Then...

1.  Project has been created in _Azure DevOps_
2.  _Git repository_ consisting of the web app has been cloned into the project
3.  In _Azure Portal_: 2 x Web apps were deployed with **_Application Insight_** enabled (One web app for development and one for the release/production).
4.  Back in _Azure DevOps_ 2 x pipelines have been created with each having its own pipeline.yml file (Release pipeline with `release-pipeline.yml` and development pipeline with `development-pipeline.yml`) - Repository needs to be connected to the pipelines.
5.  Edited the stages within the `development-pipeline.yml` to have the stages **_build, test and deployment_**
6.  Configured the release pipeline to only have a **_release job_** in the `release-pipeline.yml` and to take the build created in the building stage of the development pipeline.
7.  Following restrictions have been set before running the release pipeline, to prevent releasing on every commit:
    - Authorized users are allowed to run the release pipeline after review (checking)
    - Checking will be asked in the release pipeline as soon as the development pipeline is run

## Lessons learned

### Main issue

There were major issues with the web app finding the `package.json` file during the deployment stage, since it used to be in the subfolder _../Lab2/myExpressApp_.
Thus, I was unfortunatelly forced to move the files `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and the folder `node_modules` to the root of the repository instead.

**Edit**: I did it. It was very simple, still so confusing - _"quite of a headache"_.

1. **_Azure Portal_**
2. Open Web app Service
3. Configuration
4. Application Configuration
5. Add a new Application Configuration
6. Enter for the Name `PROJECT` and for the value `<NEW ROOT PATH>` (in my case Lab2/myExpressApp)

### Notable info

Other issues consisted of _port-settings, tast-cases, Git, deployment of the web app, creating suitable pipeline.yml_ files.
In the end, _Azure_ overall is quite of a headache to navigate especially with limited ressources and for beginners, still it has to be noted
that _Azure_ is a great tool for deploying services via the cloud and after this exercise, I certainly do know how ;).
